Algorithm: Simple Arithmetic Calculator
1.	Enter an integer as user input1 inside the main method.
2.	Enter an integer as user input2.
3.	Enter any user input operation (+, -, *, /)
4.	Inside a do while loop that matches the correct character [ ‘+’|’ - ‘|’ *’| ‘/’]
5.	From the input character, select any cases that match the switch cases. 
6.	If it is case: + then add two inputs.
7.	If ‘- ‘then subtracts
8.	If ‘*’ then Multiply.
9.	If ‘/’ then Divide.
10.	By default: print Incorrect operation!
11.	Ask for scanner input again.
12.	Output the result of the operations.
13.	Close the switch case with bracket.
14.	Inside the main method again ask for a character to enter by the user.
15.	Closing the do while condition (opr =='+'||opr == '-'||opr == '*'|| opr =='/').
16.	Closing the input scanner
17.	Closing the main method and class
